  For my third year project, I formalised Ben Green's recent construction of large corner-free sets ~\cite{Green2021} in the Lean 4 Theorem Prover. My formalisation can be found at \href{https://github.com/grhkm21/LeanCornerFree/tree/master}. This essay complements the project by explaining what mathematical formalisation actually is, and my contribution throughout the project.
