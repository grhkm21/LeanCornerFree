\section{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Damiano Testa, for his tremendous support, encouragement, and the insightful discussions about the project during our weekly meetings. I would also like to thank Julian Berman, who is the creator of the \texttt{lean.nvim} plugin. This project will be drastically slowed down without the full power of my NeoVim setup. Finally, I would like to thank the Mathlib community as a whole, who answered my questions on the Leanprover Zulip server.
