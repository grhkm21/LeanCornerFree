\section{Behrend's 3AP-free Construction}
\todo{Detailed mathematical proof of Behrend's construction, including the interpretation using Freiman isomorphism. This way I can claim \textit{original work}.}

Before we dive into Ben Green's result for corner-free sets, let us look at Behrend's 3AP-free construction from 1946, which is simple to describe and serves to motivate Ben Green's result.
