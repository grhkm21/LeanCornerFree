% part 1: tt (section 2)
% 1.1: introduce type theory
% probably leave out all the judgement stuff
% start with set theory examples, and transfer to type theory
% give an example that's useful
% (maybe with vector spaces etc, U -> V, V -> W)
% oh also drop dependent type theory, seems not important
% in turn, also ignore the Gentzen notation stuff
% just deal with plain functions and lemmas
% definitely drop filters
% and then replace U, V, W with props and go into next part
% 1.2: curry-howard correspondence
% p -> q \and q -> r thing to talk about functions <-> (constructive) logic
% be brief here...
\include{sec1-type-theory.tex}

% part 2: math, corner-free sets (section 4-5)
% first introduce the problem
% what are corner-free sets? what is the main result?
% sketch the proof, highlighting main points
\include{sec2-corner-free.tex}

% part 3: asymptotics (section 3)
% blablabla
% dot notation seems cool (p.26), maybe demo that?
\include{sec3-asymptotics.tex}

% part 4: verifying correctness via eval, decide and slim_check
% first introduce what decidability means (in Lean)
% simplest example is again IsSquare 37
% talk about how IsCornerFree is made decidable
% live demo time! #eval A (d := 2) (q := 4) 5 seems good
% mention how it's also useful during development: slim_check
\include{sec4-correctness.tex}

% part 5: conclude
