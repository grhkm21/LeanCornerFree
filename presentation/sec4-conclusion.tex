I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Damiano Testa, for his tremendous support, encouragement, and the insightful discussions about the project during our near-weekly meetings. I would also like to thank Julian Berman, who is the creator of the \texttt{lean.nvim} plugin. Without the full power of my NeoVim setup, this project would have been drastically slowed down. Finally, I would like to thank the Mathlib community as a whole, and especially to Bhavik, David, Eric, Jireh, Karl, Kendall, Kevin, Mario, Thomas, YaÃ«l and others (in alphabetical order), who helped with simplifying the proofs for various results and answered many of my questions.
